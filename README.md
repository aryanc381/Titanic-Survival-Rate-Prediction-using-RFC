In this Kaggle project utilizing the Titanic dataset, I developed a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) to predict passenger survival outcomes. The model leverages various features, including seat class, ticket fare, age, sex, number of parents/children aboard, and number of siblings/spouses aboard, etc to make its predictions.
